# Bird-Call-Identification-Using-Machine-Learning

Using machine learning and deep learning, we are able to predict the changes of a bird being in a particular habitat based on the sounds that are being generated in a particular locality. 

Understanding the species present in a particular habitat could be quite useful for understanding the diversity and the overall environment status that is present in the place respectively. As a result, this would ensure that different organizations are taking action to preserve the biodiversity of a particular habitat and also taking steps to enrich it respectively. 

In this machine learning project, we are going to be predicting the presence of different birds that are present in a particular habitat and this would ensure that we are going to be using different machine learning models for prediction respectively.
